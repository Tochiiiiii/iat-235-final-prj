                                century handmade furniture was too large, heavy, and difficult to produce. He had the idea of
                                creating furniture that could be produced by machines, furniture that would be simpler in style and
                                more affordable for the mass market. After De Stijl magazine published Gerrit Rietveld's work slatted chair in
                                1919, Gerrit began to become known as a designer and it was the beginning of a meteoric career as a designer.
