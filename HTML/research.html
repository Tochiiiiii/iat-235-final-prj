                            <h2>Red Blue Chair</h2>
                            <p>The Red and Blue Chair is Rietveld's most famous piece of furniture. 
                                The first design of this chair dates back to 1917. With this lounge chair,
                                 Rietveld reduced the traditional armchair to 13 square-profiled battens, 
                                 two armrests with a rectangular profile and two rectangular panels that form 
                                 the seat and the back rest. As such, he stripped the traditional chair of
                                  its volume and emphasized functionality
                  
                                  Rietveld added the colours red, blue, 
                                  yellow and black around 1923 and removed the side panels.
                                  It was during this period that he was active at De Stijl,
                                   where he had previously published comparable coloured interiors.

                                  Gerrit Rietveld designed his last chair for jeweller Steltman's shop at the age of 75.
                                  With this design he once again proved his status as a pioneering designer. 
                                  The chair owes its name to the The Hague jeweller and royal purveyor Steltman 
                                  who commissioned Rietveld in 1963 to rebuild and furnish his shop at Noordeinde in The Hague.
