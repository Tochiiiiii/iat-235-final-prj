                            <h2>Red Blue Chair</h2>
                            <p>The Red and Blue Chair is probably Rietveld's most iconic piece of furniture.
                                The first version of this chair dates back to 1917. With this lounge chair,
                                The traditional armchair was reduced to 13 square-profiled battens by Rietveld,
                                two armrests with a rectangular profile and two rectangular panels that form
                                the seat and the back rest. As such, he stripped the traditional chair of
                                its volume and emphasized functionality
                                Rietveld added the colours red, blue,
                                yellow and black color scheme in 1923 and removed the side panels.
                                This was the period when he was active at De Stijl,
                                where he had previously published comparable coloured interiors.

                            <h2>The Steltmen Chair</h2>
                            <p>At the age of 75, Gerrit Rietveld designed his 
                                last chair for jeweler Steltman's shop. In this design, 
                                he once again demonstrated his position as a pioneer. 
                                In 1963, the jeweler and royal purveyor Steltman commissioned
                                 Rietveld to rebuild and furnish his Noordeinde shop in The Hague,
                                  giving the chair its name.

                                Originally, Steltman chairs were upholstered in white artificial leather. 
                                In comparison to the original artificial leather upholstery, the wooden 
                                version was constructed only after Rietveld's death in 1964.
